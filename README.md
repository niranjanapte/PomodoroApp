Pomodoro Timer with Break Reminders

How it works:
Work sessions are 25 minutes; breaks are 5 minutes.

After every fourth break, you get a 15-minute long break.

During each break, a random reminder (stretch, hydrate, pranayam) pops up.

Uses tkinter for the GUI and threading to keep the UI responsive.
